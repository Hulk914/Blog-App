# Blog-App

This is a basic blog app that demonstrated the RESTful architecture and uses mongoDb to store information, there is no user management yet.<br>
We can add new blog posts with images and view each post in show routes <br>
This app is built using expressJS and semantic UI.<br>

# Instructions to run
